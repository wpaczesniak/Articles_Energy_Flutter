const String floatingPhotovoltaic = 'Although floating PV (photovoltaic) technology is more in its infancy than its heyday, it has good prospects. This is mainly due to the limited availability of land on which to install traditional solar panels. The potential and experience of the floating PV sector is presented in a report by Solar Power Europe. Cataloguing best practices and gathering expertise on floating PV is the main objective of the report prepared by Solar Power Europe (SPE). The organization points out that floating photovoltaic installations are beginning to appear around the world - they have been operating in Asia and Europe for several years. However, climate crises with increasing competition for land will accelerate the use of the technology. As SPE points out, all parties interested in floating PV (FPV) development - from developers to public authorities to local communities - should have access to knowledge, experience and case studies on floating PV. Indeed, the implementation of photovoltaic projects on water - both on land and offshore reservoirs - requires appropriate technical adaptation in juxtaposition with traditional photovoltaics, both at the design, construction and operation stages of PV power plants. A source of information on this subject is to be the first "handbook" on floating PV just prepared by SPE.';
